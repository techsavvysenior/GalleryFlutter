Welcome to my Flutter project! This project demonstrates the use of various animations and follows clean architecture principles for a structured and maintainable codebase. If you're new to the project, this README will help you get started and understand the key features.

## Project Overview

This Flutter project showcases the following features:

- Parallax scrolling effect
- Hero animations for smooth transitions between screens
- Fading animations for a visually appealing user interface
- Clean architecture for organized code
- Freezed for generating models
- GoRouter for navigation


## Features

## Parallax Scrolling Effect
The project includes a parallax scrolling effect. This creates an engaging and dynamic user experience.

## Hero Animations
Hero animations are used to create seamless transitions between screens. For instance, when you navigate from the product list to the product details page, a smooth hero animation is applied.


## Fading Animations
Fading animations are used to enhance the user interface. These animations create smooth transitions and highlight elements when needed.

## Clean Architecture
The project follows clean architecture principles to separate concerns and create a maintainable codebase. The architecture is divided into three layers: domain, data, and presentation.

## Freezed Models
We use Freezed to generate immutable models, making it easier to work with data and maintain consistency.

## GoRouter for Navigation
GoRouter is used to handle navigation and routing in a structured way. You can find route definitions and configuration in the lib/presentation/routes directory.
